# Currently in the works
- Routes and making response forming more robust
- Connecting autoindexing and directory listing to the conf
- POST request & CGI intergration into the current code
- Request parsing update with one config per port
- Make timeouts more robust
- Fix for possible new error with partial request detection
# Coming/still missing
- Size limits for requests (headers and body) and sending
- File upload, access of uploaded files, deleting uploaded files
	- Have to adapt caching to work with deleting files
- More robust defaults
- Clear mandatory fields, and validation
- Testing testing testing
	- Look for errors everywhere (empty input, bad input, timeouts etc.)
- More pages, more error codes
	- Server error 500 must be implemented just in case
- Create default configuration file at some wise path
- For uploads figure out how to define upload folder (specific mapping in config, or default if given one doesn't work, or nothing specified)
- Implementation of DELETE method
- Add port validation, preferably in the config file
- Configuration file validation
	- Missing brackets, wrong or missing values, valid port numbers, possible overflows
